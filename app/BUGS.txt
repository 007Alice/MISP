Existing bugs:

- timeout admin_user.
1 search attributes: next page goes to search, search again, then at next page.
- Somehow there got a user_id 0 in events.
- View User and Events got lost(?), but is still there in 0.2.2

Fixed bugs:

- some admin routing.
- timeout user (?).
- list servers: error lastpushed/pulledid.
- attribute with type filename|md5 -> filename, remove |..
- add attachment show only categroies with attachment and malware-sample types.
- add attribute, non-valide, correct, ´black-holed´.
- view event, edit attribute, no validation.
- add user, some validation error then extra: authkey not defined.
- authError gets displayed before login.
- IE, no download (Js) (CakePHP bug #2554 related?)
- uppercases in md5 or sha1 when type filename|md5/sha1 is not lc like type md5/sha1.
