This document details the steps to install MISP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x (RHEL 7.x). At time of this writing it
was tested on version 7.4.

The following assumptions with regard to this installation have been made.

0.1/ A valid support agreement allowing the system to register to the Red Hat Customer Portal and receive updates
0.2/ The ability to enable additional RPM repositories, specifically the EPEL and Software Collections (SCL) repos
0.3/ This system will have direct or proxy access to the Internet for updates. Or connected to a Red Hat Satellite Server
0.4/ This document is to get a MISP instance up and running over HTTP. I haven't done a full test of all features

+----------------------------------------------+

1.1/ Complete a minimal RHEL installation, configure IP address to connect automatically.
1.2/ Configure system hostname
hostnamectl set-hostname misp # You're choice, in a production environment, it's best to use a FQDN

1.3/ Register the system for updates with Red Hat Subscription Manager
subscription-manager register # register your system to an account
subscription-manager attach   # attach your system to a current subscription

1.4/ Enable the optional, extras and Software Collections (SCL) repos
subscription-mmanager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
subscription-mmanager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
subscription-mmanager repos --enable rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms

1.5/ Update the system and reboot
yum udpate

## NOTE: As time of writing performing a yum update results in the rhel-7-server-rt-beta-rpms being forbidden
## The repo can be disabled using the following command
subscription-manager repos --disable rhel-7-server-rt-beta-rpms
