Existing bugs:

- timeout admin_user.
- search attributes: next page goes to search, search again, then at next page.
- Somehow there got a user_id 0 in events.
- View User and Events got lost(?), but is still there in 0.2.2

Fixed bugs:

- some admin routing.
- timeout user (?).
- list servers: error lastpushed/pulledid.
- attribute with type filename|md5 -> filename, remove |..
