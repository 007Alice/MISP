	<h3>First run of the system:</h3>
	When first logging into MISP with the username and password provided by your administrator, there are a number of things that need to be done, before you can start using the system.<br><br>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Acceping the Terms of use:</em> The terms of use are shown immediately after logging in for the first time, make sure to read through this page before clicking "Accept Terms" at the bottom of the page.<br /><br /></li>
		<li><em>Changing the password:</em> As a next step, change the password provided by your administrator to something of your own choosing. Click on My profile on the left navigation menu, under Global Actions, which will bring up the User view. Click on Edit User on the left navigation menu or Edit Profile in the top right corner. This next screen, allows you to edit your details, including your password, by filling out the password field, but keep in mind that the password has to be at least 6 characters long, has to include at least one upper-case and one lower-case character in addition to a digit or a special character. Enter the same password into the confirm password field, before clicking submit to finalise the change.<br><br>

		<li><em>Setting up the GPG Key:</em> In order for the system to be able to encrypt the messages that you send through it, it needs to know your GPG key. You can acquire this by clicking on the PGP/GPG key link at the bottom left of the screen, then copy the entirety of the key and navigate to the Edit profile view (My Profile on the left -&gt; Edit profile in the top right corner). Paste the key into the Gpgkey field and click submit.<br /><br />

		<li><em>Turning Auto-alerts on:</em> Turning auto-alerts on will allow the system to send you e-mail notifications about any new public events entered into the system by other users and private events added by members of your organisation. To turn this on, navigate to the Edit profile view (My profile on the left navigation menu -&gt; Edit profile in the top right corner). Tick the auto-alert checkbox and click submit to enable this feature.<br>
		<p><img src="/img/doc/" alt = "" title="Tick this checkbox to enable auto-alerts."></p><br></li>
		<li><em>Reviewing the Terms &amp; Conditions:</em> To review the Terms &amp; Conditions or to use the User Guide, use the appropriate button on the left navigation menu.<br /><br></li>
		<li><em>Making sure that compatibility mode is turned off (IE9&amp;IE10):</em>Compatibility mode can cause some elements to appear differently than intended or not appear at all. Make sure you have this option turned off.</li></ul>
